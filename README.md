// ASI Agents Hackathon: My Agents are Collaborative Learning Agents
// Project Overview
A decentralized learning system with two uAgents:
- **ChatAgent**: Receives user queries and forwards to TutorAgent (Agentverse: agent1qt9yu6nhpkl7zdasza5e2a4p0scjwt76xv39krdznnh0gdwvq4nrk8f9uzv).
- **TutorAgent**: Uses a knowledge graph (MeTTa-inspired) to provide educational responses.

**Problem**:  Access is limited to personalized education in remote areas.
**Solution**: Agents collaborate to deliver tailored learning via Agentverse.

**Agent Addresses**:
- ChatAgent: agent1qt9yu6nhpkl7zdasza5e2a4p0scjwt76xv39krdznnh0gdwvq4nrk8f9uzv
- TutorAgent: agent1qt69vgkuuzt6zw5t4xv34jd2pznd405ty2tkfcdesf39uaqcge73kp0qrnv

// Tech Stack
- uAgents (Fetch.ai) for agent communication.
- Python-based knowledge graph (MeTTa prototype: `math_knowledge.metta`).
- ngrok for Agentverse deployment.

// Setup
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/Foreignmaster7/basic_agent`
2. Activate venv: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install: `pip install uagents`
4. Run: `python tutor_agent.py`, `python basic_agent.py`, `python test_communication.py`
5. For Agentverse: Use ngrok (`https://unshattered-filomena-sottedly.ngrok-free.dev/submit` for ChatAgent).
